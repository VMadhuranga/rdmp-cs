   A data structure is a way to store and organize data in memory so it can be used efficiently.

1. **What are some of the common data structures?**

   <details>
   <summary>Reveal</summary>

   - Array
   - Linked list
   - Stack
   - Queue
   - Hash table
   - Tree
   - Heap
   - Graph

1. **What are primitive data structures?**

   <details>
   <summary>Reveal</summary>

   Primitive data structures are primitive data types that can hold a single value.

   Eg: int, float, char, pointer

   </details><br />

1. **What are non-primitive data structures?**

   <details>
   <summary>Reveal</summary>

   Non-primitive data structures are divided into two types:

   - Linear data structures
   - Non-linear data structures

   </details><br />

1. **What are linear data structures?**

   <details>
   <summary>Reveal</summary>

   In linear data structures, data are arranged in a sequential manner.
   In these data structures, one element is connected to only one another element in a linear form.

   Eg: Array, Linked list, Stack, Queue

   </details><br />

1. **What are non-linear data structures?**

   <details>
   <summary>Reveal</summary>

   In non-linear data structures, data are arranged in a random manner.
   In these data structures, one element is connected to "n" number of elements.

   Eg: Tree, Graph

   </details><br />

1. **What are static data structures?**

   <details>
   <summary>Reveal</summary>

   In static data structures, the maximum size is fixed, and the size allocated at compile time.

   </details><br />

1. **What are dynamic data structures?**

   <details>
   <summary>Reveal</summary>

   In dynamic data structures, the maximum size is flexible, and the size allocated at runtime.

   </details><br />

1. **What are some common operations that can be performed on data structures?**

   <details>
   <summary>Reveal</summary>

   - Search elements
   - Sort elements
   - Insert elements
   - Update elements
   - Delete elements

   </details><br />

1. **What is the difference between abstract data type and data structure?**

   <details>
   <summary>Reveal</summary>

   Abstract data type gives the blueprint, while data structure provides the implementation.
